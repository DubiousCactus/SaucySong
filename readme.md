## What's SaucySong ?

SaucySong is a community-based web app allowing friends to share their music discoveries from YouTube and SoundCloud. Every new entry is sorted in its respective music genre/style, making the process of finding music you like easier. 

- Ranking system
- Points system preventing users from posting crappy commercial music (the community decides)
- Subscribing feature, a-la-SoundCloud, putting your friends' discoveries ahead in your feed
- No single bit of music is stored on our servers, it is a simple relay to SoundCloud/YouTube

## How can I help ?

We mostly need designers and front-end coders (gosh do I hate that part), but any idea that could enhance the app is more than welcome to be shared !

## What about copyrights and stuff ?

Well I don't know, wait and see.
